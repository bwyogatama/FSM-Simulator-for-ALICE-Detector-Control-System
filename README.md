# FSM-Simulator-for-ALICE-Detector-Control-System

Welcome to my Github Page!!

Here is my sourcecode and screenshots of my summer student project. The program is written in C programming language. To run the sourcecode, you will need WinCC OA and JCOP Framework provided by CERN. 

Good luck!!

Special thanks to: Dr. Ombretta Pinazza from ALICE-DCS group.
